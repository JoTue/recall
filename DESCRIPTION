Description: recall (Calibrated Clustering with Artificial Variables) is a method for protecting
 against over-clustering by controlling for the impact of double-dipping. The approach 
    can be applied to any clustering algorithm (implemented are the Louvain and Leiden algorithms with
    plans forK-means, and hierarchical clustering algorithms). The method provides state-of-the-art
    clustering performance and can rapidly analyze large-scale scRNA-seq studies and is 
    compatible with the Seurat library.
